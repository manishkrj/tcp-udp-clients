# Instructions for Running Server and Client Scripts

This repository contains scripts for a simple client-server application. Follow the steps below to set up and run the server and client scripts.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3 installed on your system.

## Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine

2. **Run the Server**:  
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory in your terminal.
- Run the `server.py` script using the following command:
  ```bash
  python3 server.py
  ```
This will start the server.

3. **Run the Client**:  
- Open multiple terminal windows or tabs for running multiple clients(tcp/udp).
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory in each terminal.
- Run the `client_tcp.py` and `client_udp.py` script in each terminal using the following command:
  ```bash
  python3 client_tcp.py
  ```
  ```bash
  python3 client_udp.py
  ```
This will start a client instance for each terminal.

4. **Interact with the Application**:  
Once the server and clients are running, all tcp and udp clients can interact each other.

## Additional Information
- The server script (`server.py`) should be running before starting any client instances.
- You can customize the server and client scripts to suit your requirements.
